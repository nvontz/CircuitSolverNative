Dependency issue with TFLite

Need to move picture to a take photo class and have it open when user clicks a button. Picture is then moved into a variable that we sent through ML after user confirmation.

Need to add gallery functionality to make iamges selectable from camera roll.

Need to build out a better UI with how a user would interact. 

Need to test connection to a server.
 <then set up display for the return value>
 
Need to think about marking nodes, setting values, and other user inputs that might need to be changed/edit from the ML if it's incorrect.
